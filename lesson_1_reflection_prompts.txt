How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

We can see what we add or remove (changes) it help us make comparison and find the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps finding bugs fastly and improve our comprehension of the whole code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

  Pros Manually: - Put in a paper ideas;
  Cons Manually: - Storage, Access, Changes;
  Pros Automatically: - Storage, Management, Easy to access, Changes;
  Cons Automatically: - If off-line VCS no access, only 30 days etc. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because VCS like Git is  for coding. And many times we do need multiple files with different task that the outcome is to solve one problem.
	In the other hand VCS like Google Docs is for generic purpose where one files itself supports all is needed to the project. Eg: Write a book.

	How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git diff firstID secondID

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We can always go back to previous version where the code was functioning

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Develop softwares using git. ;)
