local?
   A:

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    to incorporate changes made remotely to our project

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: a clone function that applies only in github repositories.
    Clone: A copy of a repo that can be local and remote
    Branch: A label of a commit and used to try out new things, to experment things that maybe we will merge to the master branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

 A:   
    It's very useful in connection issues. Because if we will have sometime without connection it's good to know the last state.
